GOA Algorithm for Sphere Optimization and FOPID Tuning

This repository provides an implementation of the Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) applied to solve the sphere optimization problem and tune FOPID controllers efficiently. The GOA, inspired by the natural behavior of grasshoppers, is a robust metaheuristic optimization technique suitable for solving various complex optimization challenges.
